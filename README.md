# StablexuiAndHaxeGuiLearningProjects
Here are projects I've made with Stablexui and Haxe in an attempt to learn Stablexui so I can make a complete tutorial in the future. I will post written tutorials on my blog https://www.tacodesu.wordpress.com of each project as they are finished, so be sure to check that out.

Feel free to have fun with this. The sole point of this project is to get familiar with Stablexui, because although there is documentation, and there are projects that have made them, there aren't many tutorial. I want to change that.
